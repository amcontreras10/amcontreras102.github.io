8. Ideas for future improvement 
a. I had trouble trying to display multiple images. In the future, I would love for 9-12 images displayed for each web-search. 

b. To imitate the sleek style of GIPHY.com, you can use an alternate background color like black.

c. Lastly, for a more competitive website, you can implement a "trending" display on the homepage to show what people are searching.
